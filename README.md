# Craftia Resource Pack

Required for all custom sounds, textures and items in the Craftia Resource Pack
Datapack will work without this however all custom items will look weird

This doesn't change much in vannila gameplay so you can keep it on at all times if wanted.

The only things it changes are:
- Pumpkins won't have any overlay (For the hats)
- Shields that have banners on are more detailed (Credit to the Vannila Tweaks team for this! [Link to their website](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs/))
